As a Part of a Hackathon in my institute , I as a participant developed this project.
The Problem Statement is:
Theme: Agriculture
Problem Statement: My Home Farm Designer
Objective:
Create a simple tool to help urbanites design a home farm/garden in their balcony or terrace spaces. 
The tool should provide users with layout design suggestions for their current home space, along 
with up to 3 garden/farm design options to choose from. It should also offer suggestions for plants 
to grow and how to arrange them based on user preferences and space details.
What it does:
The planner helps anyone — even beginners — start their own garden/farm in a small space. Users 
can enter basic details like the size of the space (width and length), whether it is sunny or shaded, 
and optionally upload a photo of their space. The tool will suggest simple garden/farm layout designs 
based on the available space and recommend aesthetic and practical garden arrangements along 
with suitable plants to grow.
Main Features:
Suggest garden/farm layout and design options based on available space.
Recommend plants based on available sunlight, space size, and user preferences (like vegetables, 
herbs, or flowers).
Provide basic reminders for watering and harvesting.
Offer simple options for vertical or container gardening styles.
Motivate users with basic progress tracking like completion status of planting steps or care 
routines.
Deliverables:
Simple website/app prototype with basic layout suggestion features, integrated with a basic 
database to store user inputs, suggested layouts, and plant information.
